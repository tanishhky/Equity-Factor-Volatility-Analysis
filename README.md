# Quantitative Equity Sector Analysis & Strategy Backtesting

This project conducts a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the 11 GICS sectors of the U.S. stock market. It utilizes established academic factor models to deconstruct sector returns, identify risk exposures, and evaluates a dynamic sector rotation strategy through backtesting.

The primary goal is to move beyond simple performance metrics and understand the underlying drivers of sector risk and return, culminating in a practical, rule-based investment strategy.

## Methodology: Using Sector ETFs as Proxies

To analyze sector-level performance, this project uses the 11 Sector SPDR ETFs. These are industry-standard, highly liquid, and investable instruments that serve as proxies for the performance of the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) sectors of the S&P 500. This approach allows for the analysis of broad sector trends without the complexity of building and maintaining a custom index from hundreds of individual stocks.

The following ETFs were used:

* **XLK**: Technology
* **XLF**: Financials
* **XLV**: Health Care
* **XLY**: Consumer Discretionary
* **XLP**: Consumer Staples
* **XLE**: Energy
* **XLI**: Industrials
* **XLB**: Materials
* **XLU**: Utilities
* **XLRE**: Real Estate
* **XLC**: Communication Services

## Key Analyses

The project is structured into three main parts:

### 1. Expanded Factor Model Analysis

This section applies multiple asset pricing models to determine the drivers of sector returns. The goal is to quantify a sector's sensitivity to systematic risk factors (its Betas) and measure its idiosyncratic, skill-based performance (its Alpha).

* **Models Used:** Fama-French 3-Factor, Carhart 4-Factor, and the Fama-French 5-Factor models.

### 2. Sector Rotation Strategy Backtesting

A quantitative momentum-based sector rotation strategy is developed and backtested against the S&P 500 (SPY) benchmark. The strategy invests in the top 3 sectors with the highest momentum over the preceding 6 months, rebalancing monthly.

### 3. Cross-Sectional & Macroeconomic Risk Analysis

This analysis uses rolling regressions to calculate time-varying factor betas for each sector. The results are visualized as heatmaps to show how sector risk profiles evolve in response to different market regimes.

## Findings & Importance

### Factor Model Insights

* **High Explanatory Power**: The Fama-French models explained a very high portion (**92-93%**) of the tech sector's daily returns, validating their use for risk decomposition.
* **Quantified Sector DNA**: The analysis statistically confirmed that the technology sector is **21% more volatile than the market** (`Mkt_RF` beta > 1), has a strong bias toward **large-cap stocks** (negative `SMB` beta), and exhibits a clear **growth characteristic** (negative `HML` beta).
* **Modern Factors Matter**: Adding **Momentum** (`MOM`) and **Profitability** (`RMW`) factors significantly improved the model's accuracy. This demonstrates an understanding of modern asset pricing theory beyond the basic models and highlights that sector performance is also driven by trend-following and corporate financial health.

***Importance for Risk/Quant Roles***: This demonstrates the ability to use econometric models to break down portfolio returns, identify key risk exposures, and determine if performance is due to market factors or genuine alphaâ€”a core task in performance attribution and risk management.

### Sector Rotation Strategy Performance

* **Superior Risk Management**: The most critical finding was that the momentum strategy, while achieving similar returns to the benchmark (16.51% vs. 17.40% CAGR), did so with **significantly less risk**. Its maximum drawdown was **-15.97%** compared to the S&P 500's **-23.97%**.
* **Practical Value**: This result is highly important as it shows the strategy's effectiveness in preserving capital during market downturns, a primary objective for any risk-conscious investor or portfolio manager.

### Rolling Beta & Macroeconomic Insights

* **Dynamic Risk Profiles**: The heatmaps reveal that sector risk profiles are not static. For example, the market beta heatmap shows a market-wide **correlation spike during the 2020 crash**, visually demonstrating how diversification benefits can evaporate during a crisis.
* **Visualizing Market Regimes**: The value (HML) factor heatmap effectively captures the major **market rotation from growth to value stocks in 2022** as inflation and interest rates rose. This ability to visualize and interpret regime changes is crucial for tactical asset allocation and risk modeling.
